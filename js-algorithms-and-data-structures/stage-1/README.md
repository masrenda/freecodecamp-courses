JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.

In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript.
You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll
learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and
more.

## Roadmap

### 1. Comment Your Javascript Code

Try creating one of each type of comment.

```js
// This is an in-line comment.

/* This is a
multi-line comment */
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 2. Declare Javascript Variables

Use the `var` keyword to create a variable called `myName`.

```js
var myName;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 3. Storing Values with The Assignment Operator

Assign the value `7` to variable `a`.

```js
var a;

var myVar = 7;
a = myVar;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 4. Assigning The Value of One Variable to Another

Assign the contents of `a` to variable `b`.

```js
var a;
a = 7;
var b;

b = a;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 5. Initializing Variables with The Assignment Operator

Define `a` variable a with `var` and initialize it to a value of `9`.

```js
var a = 9;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 6. Declare String Variables

Create `two` new string variables: `myFirstName` and `myLastName` and assign
them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

```js
var myFirstName = "Jhon";
var myLastName = "Doe";

myFirstName + myLastName;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 7. Understanding Uninitialized Variables

Initialize the three variables `a`, `b`, and `c` with `5`, `10`, and `"I am a"`
respectively so that they will not be `undefined`.

```js
var a;
var b;
var c;

var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 8. Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables

Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use _camelCase_.
Do not create any new variables.

```js
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 9. Explore Differences between The var and let Keywords

Update the code so it only uses the `let` keyword.

```js
let catName = "Oliver";
let catSound = "Meow!";
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 10. Declare a read-only Variable with The const Keyword

Change the code so that all variables are declared using `let` or `const`. Use
`let` when you want the variable to change, and `const` when you want the
variable to remain constant. Also, rename variables declared with `const` to
conform to common practices. Do not change the strings assigned to the
variables.

```js
const FCC = "freeCodeCamp";
let fact = "is cool!";

fact = "is awesome!";
console.log(FCC, fact);
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 11. Add Two Number with Javascript

Change the `0` so that sum will equal `20`.

```js
const sum = 20 + 0;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 12. Subtract One Number from Another with Javascript

Change the `0` so the difference is `12`.

```js
const difference = 45 - 33;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 13. Multiply Two Numbers with Javascript

Change the `0` so that product will equal `80`.

```js
const product = 8 * 10;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 14. Divide One Number by Another with Javascript

Change the `0` so that the `quotient` is equal to `2`.

```js
const quotient = 66 / 33;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 15. Increment a Number with Javascript

Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.

```js
let myVar = 87;

myVar++;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 16. Decrement a Number with Javascript

Change the code to use the `--` operator on `myVar`.

```js
let myVar = 11;

myVar--;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 17. Create Decimal Number with Javascript

Create a variable `myDecimal` and give it a decimal value with a fractional part
(e.g. `5.7`).

```js
const ourDecimal = 5.7;

const myDecimal = 5.7;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 18. Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript

Change the `0.0` so that product will equal `5.0`.

```js
const product = 2.0 * 2.5;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 19. Divide One Decimal by Another with Javascript

Change the `0.0` so that `quotient` will equal to `2.2`.

```js
const quotient = 4.4 / 2.0;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 20. Finding a Remainder in JavaScript

Set `remainder` equal to the remainder of `11` divided by `3` using the
remainder (`%`) operator.

```js
const remainder = 2 % 6;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 21. Compound Assignment with Augmented Addition

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `+=` operator.

```js
let a = 3;
let b = 17;
let c = 12;

a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 22. Compound Assignment with Augmented Subtraction

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `-=` operator.

```js
let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

a -= 6;
b -= 15;
c -= 1;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 23. Compound Assignment with Augmented Multiplication

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `*=` operator.

```js
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 24. Compound Assignment with Augmented Division

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `/=` operator.

```js
let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 25. Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings

Use backslashes to assign a string to the `myStr` variable so that if you were
to print it to the console, you would see:

> I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".

```js
const myStr = 'I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".';
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 26. Quoting Strings with Single Quotes

Change the provided string to a string with single quotes at the beginning and
end and no escape characters.

Right now, the `<a>` tag in the string uses double quotes everywhere. You will
need to change the outer quotes to single quotes so you can remove the escape
characters.

```js
const myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 27. Escape Sequences in Strings

Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable `myStr` using
escape sequences.

> FirstLine <br>       \SecondLine <br> ThirdLine

You will need to use escape sequences to insert special characters correctly.
You will also need to follow the spacing as it looks above, with no spaces
between escape sequences or words.

Note: The indentation for `SecondLine` is achieved with the tab escape
character, not spaces.

```js
const myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine";
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 28. Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator

Build `myStr` from the strings `This is the start`. and `This is the end`. using
the `+` operator. Be sure to include a space between the two strings.

```js
const myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 29. Concatenating Strings with Plus Equal Operator

Build `myStr` over several lines by concatenating these two strings:
`This is the first sentence`. and `This is the second sentence`. using the `+=`
operator. Use the `+=` operator similar to how it is shown in the example and be
sure to include a space between the two strings. Start by assigning the first
string to `myStr`, then add on the second string.

```js
let myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 30. Constructing Strings with Variables

Set `myName` to a string equal to your name and build `myStr` with `myName`
between the strings `My name is` and `and I am well!`

```js
const myName = "Jhon";
const myStr = "My name is " + myName + "and I am well!";
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 31. Appending Variables to Strings

Set `someAdjective` to a string of at least 3 characters and append it to
`myStr` using the `+=` operator.

```js
const someAdjective = "Hello Jhon Doe";
let myStr = "Learning to code is ";

myStr += someAdjective;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 32. Find the Length of a String

Use the `.length` property to set `lastNameLength` to the number of characters
in `lastName`.

```js
let lastNameLength = 0;
const lastName = "Lovelace";

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 33. Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String

Use bracket notation to find the first character in the `lastName` variable and
assign it to `firstLetterOfLastName`.

```js
let firstLetterOfLastName = "";
const lastName = "Lovelace";

firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 34. Understand String Immutability

Correct the assignment to `myStr` so it contains the string value of
`Hello World` using the approach shown in the example above.

```js
let myStr = "Jello World";

myStr = "Hello World";
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 35. Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String

Let's try to set `thirdLetterOfLastName` to equal the third letter of the
`lastName` variable using bracket notation.

```js
const lastName = "Lovelace";

const thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 36. Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String

Use _bracket notation_ to find the last character in the `lastName` variable.

```js
const lastName = "Lovelace";

const lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 37. Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String

Use _bracket notation_ to find the second-to-last character in the `lastName`
string.

```js
const lastName = "Lovelace";

const secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 38. Word Blanks

In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an
adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along
with the words we provide.

You will need to use the string concatenation operator `+` to build a new
string, using the provided variables: `myNoun`, `myAdjective`, `myVerb`, and
`myAdverb`. You will then assign the formed string to the `wordBlanks` variable.
You should not change the words assigned to the variables.

You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final
sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete
sentence.

```js
const myNoun = "dog";
const myAdjective = "big";
const myVerb = "ran";
const myAdverb = "quickly";

const wordBlanks = myNoun + " " + myAdjective + " " + myVerb + " " + myAdverb;
```

### 39. Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays

Modify the new array `myArray` so that it contains both a string and a number
(in that order).

```js
const myArray = ["jhon", 2];
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 40. Nest one Array within Another Array

Create a nested array called `myArray`.

```js
const myArray = [["Jhon"], ["Doe"]];
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 41. Access Array Data with Indexes

Create a variable called `myData` and set it to equal the first value of
`myArray` using bracket notation.

```js
const myArray = [50, 60, 70];

const myData = myArray[0];
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 42. Modify Array Data With Indexes

Modify the data stored at index `0` of `myArray` to a value of `45`.

```js
const myArray = [18, 64, 99];

myArray[0] = 45;
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 43. Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes

Using bracket notation select an element from `myArray` such that `myData` is
equal to `8`.

```js
const myArray = [
	[1, 2, 3],
	[4, 5, 6],
	[7, 8, 9],
	[[10, 11, 12], 13, 14],
];

const myData = myArray[2][1];
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 44. Manipulate Arrays With push()

Push `["dog", 3]` onto the end of the `myArray` variable.

```js
const myArray = [
	["John", 23],
	["cat", 2],
];

myArray.push(["dog", 3]);
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 45. Manipulate Arrays With pop()

Use the `.pop()` function to remove the last item from `myArray` and assign the
popped off value to a new variable, `removedFromMyArray`.

```js
const myArray = [
	["John", 23],
	["cat", 2],
];

const removedFromMyArray = myArray.pop();
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 46. Manipulate Arrays With shift()

Use the `.shift()` function to remove the first item from `myArray` and assign
the "shifted off" value to a new variable, `removedFromMyArray`.

```js
const myArray = [
	["John", 23],
	["dog", 3],
];

const removedFromMyArray = myArray.shift();
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 47. Manipulate Arrays With unshift()

Add `["Paul", 35]` to the beginning of the `myArray` variable using `unshift()`.

```js
const myArray = [
	["John", 23],
	["dog", 3],
];
myArray.shift();

myArray.unshift(["Paul", 35]);
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 48. Shopping List

Create a shopping list in the variable `myList`. The list should be a
multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the
item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.

> ```js
> ["Chocolate Bar", 15];
> ```

There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.

```js
var myList = [
	["Canned Beans", 3],
	["Milk Galon", 1],
	["Cereal", 2],
	["Toilet Paper", 12],
	["Sack of Rice", 1],
];
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 49. Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions

1. Create a function called `reusableFunction` which prints the string
   `Hi World` to the dev console.
2. Call the function.

```js
function reusableFunction() {
	console.log("Hi World");
}

reusableFunction();
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 50. Passing Values to Functions with Arguments

1. Create a function called `functionWithArgs` that accepts two arguments and
   outputs their sum to the dev console.
2. Call the function with two numbers as arguments.

```js
function functionWithArgs(param1, param2) {
	console.log(param1 + param2);
}

functionWithArgs(7, 3);
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 51. Return a Value from a Function with Return

Create a function `timesFive` that accepts one argument, multiplies it by `5`,
and returns the new value.

```js
function timesFive(num) {
	return num * 5;
}

timesFive(1);
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 52. Global Scope and Functions

Using `let` or `const`, declare a global variable named `myGlobal` outside of
any function. Initialize it with a value of `10`.

Inside function `fun1`, assign `5` to `oopsGlobal` _without_ using the `var`,
`let` or `const` keywords.

```js
let myGlobal = 10;

function fun1() {
	oopsGlobal = 5;
}

function fun2() {
	var output = "";
	if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {
		output += "myGlobal: " + myGlobal;
	}
	if (typeof oopsGlobal != "undefined") {
		output += " oopsGlobal: " + oopsGlobal;
	}
	console.log(output);
}
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 53. Local Scope and Functions

The editor has two `console.log`s to help you see what is happening. Check the
console as you code to see how it changes. Declare a local variable `myVar`
inside `myLocalScope` and run the tests.

Note: The console will still display `ReferenceError: myVar is not defined`, but
this will not cause the tests to fail.

```js
function myLocalScope() {
	let myVar = 12;

	console.log("inside myLocalScope", myVar);
}
myLocalScope();

console.log("outside myLocalScope", myVar);
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 54. Global vs. Local Scope in Functions

Add a local variable to `myOutfit` function to override the value of `outerWear`
with the string `sweater`.

```js
const outerWear = "T-Shirt";

function myOutfit() {
	return "sweater";
	return outerWear;
}

myOutfit();
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 55. Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function

Create a function `addFive` without any arguments. This function adds 5 to the
`sum` variable, but its returned value is `undefined`.

```js
let sum = 0;

function addThree() {
	sum = sum + 3;
}

function addFive() {
	sum += 5;
}

addThree();
addFive();
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 56. Assignment with a Returned Value

Call the `processArg` function with an argument of `7` and assign its return
value to the variable `processed`.

```js
let processed = 0;

function processArg(num) {
	return (num + 3) / 5;
}

processed = processArg(7);
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 57. Stand in Line

Write a function `nextInLine` which takes an array (`arr`) and a number (`item`)
as arguments.

Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of the
array.

The `nextInLine` function should then return the element that was removed.

```js
function nextInLine(arr, item) {
	arr.push(item);
	return arr.shift();
}

let testArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

console.log("Before: " + JSON.stringify(testArr));
console.log(nextInLine(testArr, 6));
console.log("After: " + JSON.stringify(testArr));
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 58. Understanding Boolean Values

Modify the `welcomeToBooleans` function so that it returns `true` instead of
`false` when the run button is clicked.

```js
function welcomeToBooleans() {
	return true;

### 59. Use Conditional Logic with If Statements

Create an `if` statement inside the function to return `Yes, that was true` if
the parameter `wasThatTrue` is `true` and return `No, that was false` otherwise.

```js
function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {
	if (wasThatTrue === true) {
		return "Yes, that was true";
	}
	return "No, that was false";
}
```

### 60. Comparison with the Equality Operator

Add the equality operator to the indicated line so that the function will return
the string `Equal` when `val` is equivalent to `12`.

```js
function testEqual(val) {
	if (val == 12) {
		return "Equal";
	}
	return "Not Equal";
}

testEqual(10);
```

### 61. Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator

Use the strict equality operator in the `if` statement so the function will
return the string `Equal` when `val` is strictly equal to `7`.

```js
function testStrict(val) {
	if (val === 7) {
		return "Equal";
	}
	return "Not Equal";
}

testStrict(10);
```

### 62. Practice comparing different values

The `compareEquality` function in the editor compares two values using the
equality operator. Modify the function so that it returns the string `Equal`
only when the values are strictly equal.

```js
function compareEquality(a, b) {
	if (a === b) {
		return "Equal";
	}
	return "Not Equal";
}

compareEquality(10, "10");
```

### 63. Comparison with the Inequality Operator

Add the inequality operator `!=` in the `if` statement so that the function will
return the string `Not Equal` when val is not equivalent to `99`.

```js
function testNotEqual(val) {
	if (val != 99) {
		return "Not Equal";
	}
	return "Equal";
}

testNotEqual(10);
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 64. Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator

Add the strict inequality operator to the `if` statement so the function will
return the string `Not Equal` when `val` is not strictly equal to `17`.

```js
function testStrictNotEqual(val) {
	if (val !== 17) {
		return "Not Equal";
	}
	return "Equal";
}

testStrictNotEqual(10);
```

### 65. Comparison with the Greater Than Operator

Add the greater than operator to the indicated lines so that the return
statements make sense.

```js
function testGreaterThan(val) {
	if (val > 100) {
		return "Over 100";
	}

	if (val > 10) {
		return "Over 10";
	}

	return "10 or Under";
}

testGreaterThan(10);
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 66. Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator

Add the greater than or equal to operator to the indicated lines so that the
return statements make sense.

```js
function testGreaterOrEqual(val) {
	if (val >= 20) {
		return "20 or Over";
	}

	if (val >= 10) {
		return "10 or Over";
	}

	return "Less than 10";
}

testGreaterOrEqual(10);
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 67. Comparison with the Less Than Operator

Add the less than operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements
make sense.

```js
function testLessThan(val) {
	if (val < 25) {
		return "Under 25";
	}

	if (val < 55) {
		return "Under 55";
	}

	return "55 or Over";
}

testLessThan(10);
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 68. Comparison with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator

Add the less than or equal to operator to the indicated lines so that the return
statements make sense.

```js
function testLessOrEqual(val) {
	if (val <= 12) {
		return "Smaller Than or Equal to 12";
	}

	if (val <= 24) {
		return "Smaller Than or Equal to 24";
	}

	return "More Than 24";
}

testLessOrEqual(10);
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 69. Comparisons with the Logical And Operator

Replace the two if statements with one statement, using the `&&` operator, which
will return the string `Yes` if `val` is less than or equal to `50` and greater
than or equal to `25`. Otherwise, will return the string `No`.

```js
function testLogicalAnd(val) {
	if (val <= 50 && val >= 25) {
		return "Yes";
	}

	return "No";
}

testLogicalAnd(10);
```

### 70. Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator

Combine the two `if` statements into one statement which returns the string
`Outside` if `val` is not between `10` and `20`, inclusive. Otherwise, return
the string `Inside`.

```js
function testLogicalOr(val) {
	if (val < 10 || val > 20) {
		return "Outside";
	}

	return "Inside";
}

testLogicalOr(15);
```

### 71. Introducing Else Statements

Combine the `if` statements into a single `if/else` statement.

```js
function testElse(val) {
	let result = "";

	if (val > 5) {
		result = "Bigger than 5";
	} else {
		result = "5 or Smaller";
	}

	return result;
}

testElse(4);
```

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

### 72. Introducing Else If Statements

Convert the logic to use `else if` statements.

```js
function testElseIf(val) {
	if (val > 10) {
		return "Greater than 10";
	} else if (val < 5) {
		return "Smaller than 5";
	} else {
		return "Between 5 and 10";
	}
}
testElseIf(7);
```

### 73. Logical Order in If Else Statements

Change the order of logic in the function so that it will return the correct
statements in all cases.

```js
function orderMyLogic(val) {
	if (val < 5) {
		return "Less than 5";
	} else if (val < 10) {
		return "Less than 10";
	} else {
		return "Greater than or equal to 10";
	}
}

orderMyLogic(7);
```

### 74. Chaining If Else Statements

Write chained `if/else if` statements to fulfill the following conditions:

`num < 5` - return `Tiny` <br> `num < 10` - return `Small` <br> `num < 15` -
return `Medium` <br> `num < 20` - return `Large` <br> `num >= 20` - return
`Huge`

```js
function testSize(num) {
	if (num < 5) {
		return "Tiny";
	} else if (num < 10) {
		return "Small";
	} else if (num < 15) {
		return "Medium";
	} else if (num < 20) {
		return "Large";
	} else if (num >= 20) {
		return "Huge";
	} else {
		return "Change Me";
	}
}

testSize(7);
```

### 75. Golf Code

In the game of Golf, each hole has a `par`, meaning, the average number of
`strokes` a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to
complete the play. Depending on how far above or below `par` your `strokes` are,
there is a different nickname.

Your function will be passed `par` and `strokes` arguments. Return the correct
string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top
(highest) to bottom (lowest):

| Strokes    | Return         |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| 1          | "Hole-in-one!" |
| <= par - 2 | "Eagle"        |
| par - 1    | "Birdie"       |
| par        | "Par"          |
| par + 1    | "Bogey"        |
| par + 2    | "Double Bogey" |
| >= par + 3 | "Go Home!"     |

`par` and `strokes` will always be numeric and positive. We have added an array
of all the names for your convenience.

```js
const names = [
	"Hole-in-one!",
	"Eagle",
	"Birdie",
	"Par",
	"Bogey",
	"Double Bogey",
	"Go Home!",
];

function golfScore(par, strokes) {
	if (strokes == 1) {
		return names[0];
	} else if (strokes <= par - 2) {
		return names[1];
	} else if (strokes === par - 1) {
		return names[2];
	} else if (strokes === par) {
		return names[3];
	} else if (strokes === par + 1) {
		return names[4];
	} else if (strokes === par + 2) {
		return names[5];
	} else {
		return names[6];
	}
}

golfScore(5, 4);
```

### 76. Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements

Write a switch statement which tests `val` and sets `answer` for the following
conditions:

`1` - `alpha` <br> `2` - `beta` <br> `3` - `gamma` <br> `4` - `delta` <br>

```js
function caseInSwitch(val) {
	let answer = "";
	switch (val) {
		case 1:
			return "alpha";
			break;
		case 2:
			return "beta";
			break;
		case 3:
			return "gamma";
			break;
		case 4:
			return "delta";
			break;
	}

	return answer;
}

caseInSwitch(1);
```

### 77. Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements

Write a switch statement to set `answer` for the following conditions: `a` -
`apple` `b` - `bird` `c` - `cat` default - stuff

```js
function switchOfStuff(val) {
	let answer = "";
	switch (val) {
		case "a":
			return "apple";
			break;
		case "b":
			return "bird";
			break;
		case "c":
			return "cat";
			break;
		default:
			return "stuff";
			break;
	}

	return answer;
}

switchOfStuff(1);
```
